# Track your time using #hashtags

...in Google Calendar!

This application let’s you track the total amount of time you spent on a project/client by tagging your activities in Google Calendar with a hashtag (like this: #bigclient). The application uses the Google Calendar API to read all the events in your calendar and add up all tagged events in a certain period of time (week, month, year). It then draws a bar graph showing the total number of hours worked on specific clients/projects.

I use this app myself to track the time I spent on my translation projects and certain clients.

The application uses jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and reads it’s data from the Google Calendar API (read only access).
